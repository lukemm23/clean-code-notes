# Clean Code Summary

### key pain points

1. naming - variables, functions, classes
2. structure & comments - code formatting, good & bad comments
3. functions - length, parameters
4. conditionals & error handling - deep nesting, missing error handling
5. classes & data structures - missing distinction, bloated classes

### solutions

1. rules & concepts
2. patterns & principles
3. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### structure

1. problems, rules & concepts - learn about bad code and why, understand the core rules and concepts you should follow
2. demos & examples - see bad and good code in action, bad to good code transformations & examples
3. challenges - analyze and transform code on your own

### patterns & principles vs clean code

1. \*clean code - writes code which is readable and easy to understand
2. patterns & principles - whites code which is maintainable and extensible

### clean architecture vs clean code

1. \*clean code - how to write code (not paradigm dependant)
2. clean architecture - where to write which code (paradigm dependant)

### quick code vs clean code

1. clean code is written over time, an iterative process (quicker with experience)
2. find ways of improving existing code
3. as project evolves, code must evolve
4. always question old code and refactor alot, embrace refactoring.
